                    At AZ Apparel, our mission is to bring the rich tradition of Moroccan clothing to a global audience. 
                    We believe that traditional garments hold cultural significance and should be accessible to everyone, 
                    no matter where they live. Our goal is to offer high-quality, authentic Moroccan apparel at an 
                    cost-effective price, ensuring that craftsmanship and heritage are never compromised.
                    <br><br> By working directly with skilled artisans in Fez, we guarantee that each piece is made 
                    with attention to detail and authenticity. We are committed to preserving Moroccan heritage while 
                    making these beautiful garments available to a wider audience.

                    What started as an idea in March 2024, AZ Apparel was founded out of my deep passion for Moroccan apparel, particularly the traditional garments worn by scholars in Morocco and the greater Maghreb area. I've always admired these unique styles, but living in the West, I found that there were limited options for purchasing authentic Moroccan clothing, and the ones available were often prohibitively expensive.
                    <br><br> So I created AZ Apparel with a simple goal: to make Moroccan apparel accessible and affordable to people who love the style but don‚Äôt have easy access to it. By sourcing our products directly from Fez, where they are made by skilled artisans, I was able to provide customers with high-quality, authentic apparel at a cost-effective price.
                    <br><br>It has been a year so far, and AZ Apparel has helped many customers find what they've been searching for, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive. Customers praise the quality and great prices and are always looking for the next drop.
